Bohemian Rhapsody
Queen
END
EMI
ROCK
Is this the real life? Is this just fantasy?
Caught in a landslide, no escape from reality
Open your eyes, look up to the skies and see
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy
Because I'm easy come, easy go
Little high, little low
Any way the wind blows doesn't really matter to me, to me
Mama, just killed a man
Put a gun against his head, pulled my trigger, now he's dead
Mama, life had just begun
But now I've gone and thrown it all away
Mama, ooh, didn't mean to make you cry
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow
Carry on, carry on as if nothing really matters
Too late, my time has come
Sends shivers down my spine, body's aching all the time
Goodbye, everybody, I've got to go
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth
Mama, ooh (any way the wind blows)
I don't wanna die
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all
I see a little silhouetto of a man
Scaramouche, Scaramouche, will you do the Fandango?
Thunderbolt and lightning, very, very frightening me
(Galileo) Galileo, (Galileo) Galileo, Galileo Figaro, magnifico
But I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me
He's just a poor boy from a poor family
Spare him his life from this monstrosity
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
No, we will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let him go)
بِسْمِ ٱللَّٰهِ
We will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (let me go)
Will not let you go (never, never, never, never let me go)
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Oh, mamma mia, mamma mia
Mamma mia, let me go
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me, for me
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye?
So you think you can love me and leave me to die?
Oh, baby, can't do this to me, baby
Just gotta get out, just gotta get right outta here
Ooh
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah
Nothing really matters, anyone can see
Nothing really matters
Nothing really matters to me

Aurora Wave Studios
ROCK,HIPHOP
Red skies burn over ocean tides
The sun sets slow, where sorrow hides
I hold your name in winds that cry
And chase your shadow through the sky

Time won't wait for hearts to heal
We break apart, yet still we feel
One last word, a silent plea
Drifting out with memory

Midnight Reverie
END
Aurora Wave Studios
JAZZ,CLASSICAL
You walked on glass skies, never fell through
Balancing clouds with a dream so true
Your voice still echoes in crystal rain
Soft as moonlight, sharp as pain

I called your name in silent screams
But you were lost in shattered dreams
Glass skies fading into grey
You're still the night, I'm still the day

PulsePoint Music
ELECTRONIC
We are ghosts inside the wires
Sparks ignite our deep desires
Through the code and binary
We breathe in beats electronically

Heartbeats lost in loops and lines
We fade in synths, forget the signs
Virtual dreams behind the screen
Where nothing’s ever what it seems

PulsePoint Music
COUNTRY
Flashing lights, electric veins
Running fast through digital lanes
Lost in echoes, neon pain
Love in loops that start again

Caught between what’s real and code
Hearts corrupted, overload
Still we dance through broken sound
Where no silence can be found

Phoenix Sound
RNB
From ashes we rise, from silence we scream
Chasing the light in a dying dream
Burned and broken, yet still we fight
Carving hope in the heart of night

With every fall, we learn to fly
With every tear, we paint the sky
Our voices blaze like fire and string
From ashes, once more, we sing
